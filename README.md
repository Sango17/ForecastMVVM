# ForecastAppMVVM
MVVM Project with Android Architecture Component.

## Note
Learning process: Using my knowledge about MVVM with Android Architecture Component and some interesting libraries.

## Dependencies used 
- LiveData: for LiveData & ViewModel, and to perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments
- Navigation: to navigate between 'destinations' within an Android application that provides a consistent API whether the destinations are implemented as Fragments, Activities, or other components
- Room: to provide an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite
- Coroutines: for a concurrency design pattern that I can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously
- Retrofit: for a Type-safe HTTP client for Android
- Kodein: for a very simple and yet very useful pure Kotlin dependency retrieval container
- Glide: for a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface
- Groupie: for a simple, flexible library for complex RecyclerView layouts
- Material Design: for a design system – backed by open-source code – that helps teams to build high-quality digital experiences
- ThreeTenABP: for a better dateTime - time support for even older Android versions
